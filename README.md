# Codopia V1.0

## Guys this will be the GitHub repo we are going to use

If you are reading it for the first time START HOSTING

I did everything you said but

- I didn't finish the dark mode but I started the code tho
- I didn't test the mailer couz I was offline
- Fixed like hundred bugs
- Tested it
- Tried to create JSON API but failed
- The test page sidebar looks weird!

## Hosting

- For the host I have heard that GoogieHost supports free mail server like [admin@codopia.blabla]("#") but I am not sure
- It also supports Node.js free. Hopefully.
- But InfintyFree is pretty solid.

Enjoy! We are git people now!!!
